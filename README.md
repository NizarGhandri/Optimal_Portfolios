# optimal_portfolios
Investigating multiple ways to build optimal portfolios relying mainly on big data analysis

##  execution.ipynb
In this notebook we find the performance of the equally weighted portfolio and the value weighted portfolio. 

## MeanVariancePortolio.ipynb 
In this notebook we detail the process to computing the tangency portfolio using a rolling window and filtered and unfiltered covariance matrices.

## portfolios folder 
Here we find the executable scripts to run the different asset allocation models. 
- equally_weighted.py
- market_weights.py
- mean_variance.py

### reinforcement_learning folder:
- agent.py
- environment.py
